# Welcome to football-analysis repository
# About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on predicting the market value of a football player. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code above attached with our powerpoint slides and dataset.

# Motivation
Being hardcore Football Fans, we could not resist but to leap at the opportunity to find out what affects the Market Value of football players given the highly inflated and ever changing transfer values of players (cough... neymar 2017, 222 million transfer fee). We wanted to investigate the most important facotrs which will affect the market value of a football player.

# Problem Definition
* Which variable is the most important in predicting the Market Value of a Football Player?
* Which Model would be the best to predict it?

# Data Visualisation Tools
* Bar-plots
* Boxplots
* Correlation Heatmap
* Scatter Plot

# Models Used 
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression
3. Decision Tree Regression

# Conclusion
* Age is the most important factor in determining Market Value of a player, followed by Goals + Assists
* In general - a footballer’s prime is very closely linked to his/her age - affecting his/her Market Value
* With AI, analysts are better able to predict the Market Value of players
* Numeric Factors such as Age, Goals + Assists which greatly influences a player’s market value should be considered seriously
* It is notable that Non-numeric factors also affect the Market Value of a player positions such as Attacking Forwards tend to have higher Market Value
* The Market Value of Players also converge & are similar in particular leagues
* Analysts should consider all such factors to avoid overpaying an inflated price for football players and their transfer fees (a.k.a neymar 222 million euros)

# What did we learn from this project?
* Applied Cross Validation GridSearch to optimise our Machine Learning Models
* Applied Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression on top of the standard Linear Regression to further enhance our predictions
